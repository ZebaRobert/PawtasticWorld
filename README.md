# Colour Scheme

![Color palette image](./assets/images/screenshots/color-palette.png)
	
This website uses a palette of colors that are often seen on child drawings off a tree.
The goal was to use the wide variety of colors to appeal to a younger audience, but at the same time not to be too much of an eye sour for everyone else.
Personally, I think I was not able to capture the idea that I had in mind and put it in to reality. The website didn't turn out horrible, but there is a lot of room for improvement. 

# Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

[Spicy Rice](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spicy+Rice?query=spicy) is used for headings on the site.

[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans#styles) is used for the body text on the site.

# Imagery

The animal and peoples images were taken from royalty-free image pages that I have credited in the credits section.

# Wireframes 

Wireframes were created only for the desktop version of the website.

# Features

The website comprises eight pages, four of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, about us page, contact us page and continents page). Other four are accessible through the continents page.(categories NA page, aerial NA page, Terrestrial NA page and aquatic NA page)

## All Pages 

A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is a Logo for Pawtastic World website and to the right are the navigation links for four pages (Home, About us, Contact Us and Continents).

A footer which contains social media icons which are linked to log in pages of the corresponding social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube).


## Home Page 

A welcome section which has a picture of a polar bear and some text below greeting the user and giving a short description what is the website's goal and how to get started.

A World Map section which has a background picture of the World and when one of the continents is hovered over it display a box around it indicating that the continent can be clicked on. Unfortunately, I was not able to maintain that design for smaller devices and I had to implement a smaller version of continents pages which would replace the world map when the device screen is smaller.

A weekly photographs section which has some text explaining to the user what its purpose it and how can the user be the part of the experience, and 2 more section under the text. One is a display for a larger image and the other has five clickable button-like images which change the image being displayed in the section above.
 
## About Us

The webpage consists of 5 section, first 3 section consist of a small paragraph and an image. The 3 paragraph answerer some question that the user might have about the creators of the webpage. Three questions being "Who are We?", "What do We do?" and "Why do we do it?". The fourth section has some text about what the goal of the website is, and lastly there is an embedded video I found on YouTube about animals which I thought would be appropriate for the website.(the authors of the video are credited in the credits section)

## Contact us

The first thing that can be seen on this page is a short text explaining how to use the system in place.

The page consists of 2 forms which are hidden at  first until the user selects one of them by clicking on a button of the desired form. Two buttons are as follows 
First is a Feedback form which user can use to give feedback on the website and tell us what they like and dislike about their experience in the site. Second is a request form for a new animal to be added on the website. Here user is able to make a request by giving basic information about the animal. (Name, region and description)

## Continents

Here the user will be greeted with text explaining how to use the page and a Disclaimer message saying that not all the content is currently available and to say tuned for what is to come.

Underneath the Information text, the user will find seven interactive cards which represent each of seven continents that the user is able to explore.

By clicking on the card, the user will be directed to a category page.

## Category page

This webpage consist of 3 sections, information text, categories  explanation section and the categories cards.

In the information section, the user will learn how to use the system in place

in the Category's explanation section, the user will learn what each of the categories represents and what to expect from it.

In the category selection section, the user will be able to choose a category they want to explore.

## Animal Pages (Aerial, Terrestrial and Aquatic)

On this web page, the user will first be greeted with an information text on the system in place and underneath the text, the user will find animal cards that fit the category and continent previously selected.

By clicking on the card with an animal picture and its name, the card will expand and revel further information about the animal.

# Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible & friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
Ensuring that the user can easily navigate to previous pages in all times

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

	No information on how to use the features on the web-site was provided on any of the pages.
	There was a lack of comments throughout my html files
	The submit button was not functional because the form action attribute was not set

# Bugs

## Solved bugs:

On animals page, when the middle card or the last card would be expanded, the first card would get pushed to upper row, and it would expand to 100% width of the parent. 
This resulted in a bad design and overlapping of the cards. While I was looking through the style.css, I saw that my flex property for the flex_item class was defined as flex:1 1 30%; and it was causing the card to expand because it allowed it to grow when it had space. By changing the property to flex:0 1 30%; I was able to fix the bug.

## Known Bugs:

When the animal card expands, the webpage will always rubber band back to the top and would not be focused on the expanded animal card. While researching this issue, I was not able to find any way to fix it without using JavaScript. The best I was able to do was to make it where the opened card would change its order in the flex container to be the first element in it, however that still doesn't do the trick when more than one card is open. The first card that was open will always be on top, any card that was opened after it would be underneath it.
