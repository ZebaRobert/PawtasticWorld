                    <h2>Fun fact:</h2>
                    <p>-Barracudas are known for their incredible speed and agility, which enables them to catch their prey with ease. They can swim at speeds of up to 27 miles per hour and have been known to leap up to 10 feet out of the water.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>-Great barracuda can eat fish almost as big as themselves. <br> 
                      -Anything too large to be eaten in one go will be held in its powerful jaws while it bites repeatedly in quick succession, shaking its head to slice its prey in half with its razor-sharp teeth.
                      </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>-These fish have shiny silver sides and countershading that help them camouflage into the water around them. <br>
                      -They are usually gray, white, or blue on top—making them blend into the blue water for anything looking down on them—with a white belly that makes them harder to see from below.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>-They are found in the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, and Atlantic oceans, with an absence only from the Eastern Pacific <br>
                      -Adult great barracudas live in and around the edges of coral reefs. They tend to avoid brackish water
                      </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>-Barracuda do not care for their fertilized eggs. They are left to drift out into the ocean and eventually take form <br>
                      -The larvae hatches and seeks shallow weedy areas on the margins of clear-water estuaries.

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>-The color of largemouth bass is generally olive-green, but some have been reported to be a stripe along their body. <br>
                      -This bass has a large mouth that extends beyond the posterior edge of their eye which is what tends to separate them from other species

                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>-Native to eastern North America. <br>
                      -Largemouth bass live mainly in lakes and rivers. The optimal habitat for this species include slow moving, quiet, clear waters with soft, shallow substrates.
                      </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>-Fertilized largemouth bass eggs are yellowish orange in color. <br>
                      -After the eggs hatch the fry form a school and are protected by the male adult while they stay in the nest for 7-10 days <br>
                      -One female can produce anywhere from 3,000-45,000 offspring at once but the average is 4,000. <br>
                      -Eggs hatch in 1-5 days, with those in warmer waters hatching more quickly.

                    <h2>Fun fact:</h2>
                    <p>Walleye get their name from their distinctive eyes, which appear to glow in the dark or in low-light conditions due to a reflective layer in their retina called the tapetum lucidum. This layer helps them see better in murky waters and during dawn or dusk, making them better hunters.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>Young walleye eat plankton. As they get older, they mostly eat fishes such as yellow perch and freshwater drum. They also eat insects, crayfish, snails, and mudpuppies
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Walleyes are largely olive and gold in color. The dorsal side of a walleye is olive, grading into a golden hue on the flanks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>Native to most of Canada and to the Northern United States.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>-A large female can lay up to 500,000 eggs, and no care is given by the parents to the eggs or fry. <br>
                      -The incubation period for the embryos is temperature-dependent, but generally lasts from 12 to 30 days

                    <h2>Fun fact:</h2>
                    <p>When hooked, they can often jump and spin out of the water in an attempt to shake the fishing line. This behavior has earned them the nickname "steelhead" among anglers.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>-Rainbow trout primarily feed on invertebrate larvae drifting in mid-water to conserve energy that would be expended if they were foraging for food in the substrate. <br>
                      -Young rainbow trout eat insect larvae, crustaceans, other aquatic invertebrates, and algae.
                      </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Rainbow trout have a slender, streamlined body with small scales and a slightly forked tail. They typically have an olive green back, silvery sides, and a pinkish-red stripe along their sides.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>Native to the Pacific Coast of North America, extending from Alaska down to the border between California and Mexico
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>-Adult rainbow trout and steelhead lay their eggs in a series of nests in gravel. <br>
                      - When they hatch, the hatchlings are still attached to, and survive on their yok sac. <br> 
                      -They remain in the protective gravel for about 2 to 3 weeks when they have shed their yolk sacs and are fit enough to survive in the open water.
