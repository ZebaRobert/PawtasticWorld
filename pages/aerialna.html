                      They can fly up to 10,000 (3 km ) feet high and dive at
                      speeds of up to 100 miles (160 kmh) per hour when hunting
                      for prey.

                    <p>
                      As opportunistic foragers, bald eagles have a fairly wide
                      diet, but generally prefer fish.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                      Adult bald eagles are extremely large birds with
                      characteristically yellow eyes and bills, white heads and
                      tails and dark brown bodies, which may appear almost
                      black.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>
                      Found throughout North America, near large water sources.
                      These birds are native to Canada, the United States,
                      portions of Mexico and several islands including Saint
                      Pierre and Miquelon

                    <p>
                      -Males and females construct their nests together, about 1
                      to 3 months prior to egg laying <br />
                      -Bald eagles typically produce 1 brood of 1 to 3 eggs per
                      season; many of their eggs do not survive <br />
                      -Bald eagles may produce up to 36 young in their lifetime
                      <br />
                      -Eggs are generally incubated for about 35 days, followed
                      by an 11 to 12 week nestling period

                      They can often be seen pulling earthworms out of the
                      ground, but they also have a sweet tooth for fruit! In
                      fact, during the winter months when food is scarce, they
                      rely heavily on fruit for survival, particularly the fruit
                      of the American mountain ash.

                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>
                      In the spring and summer, they primarily feed on insects
                      such as beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars, as well
                      as earthworms. In the fall and winter, they switch to a
                      more fruit-based diet, eating berries, crabapples, and
                      other fruits.

                      The American Robin is a medium-sized bird, with a plump
                      body and a round head. It has a grayish-brown back, with
                      the head and tail being blackish in color. The underparts
                      are a rust-red color, with a white throat and a
                      distinctive white eye-ring

                    <p>
                      -The American robin is widely distributed throughout North
                      America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico
                      and along the Pacific Coast <br />
                      -American robins occur mainly in woodlands, gardens,
                      orchards, lawns, and fields. <br />
                      -They prefer areas of open ground or short grass for
                      foraging, with woodland or a few scattered trees and
                      shrubs nearby for nesting and roosting.

                    <p>
                      -American Robins typically breed in spring and early
                      summer, with females building cup-shaped nests from grass,
                      twigs, and mud. <br />
                      -The nest is usually placed in a tree or shrub, and the
                      female lays a clutch of 3-5 blue eggs. <br />
                      -Both parents take turns incubating the eggs, which hatch
                      after about 12-14 days. <br />
                      -The chicks are born naked and helpless, and both parents
                      feed and care for them until they fledge at around 14-16
                      days old. <br />
                      -American Robins are known to have two or three broods per
                      year.
