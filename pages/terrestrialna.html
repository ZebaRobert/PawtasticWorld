                    <h2>Fun fact:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -They have a remarkable sense of smell, which is one of
                      the best among land animals. Grizzly bears can detect
                      odors from up to two miles away, and they use their sense
                      of smell to locate food, mates, and potential threats. In
                      fact, their sense of smell is so good that they can detect
                      buried carcasses under three feet of snow or soil, and
                      they can even distinguish between different types of
                      berries based on their scent. Grizzly bears' sense of
                      smell is estimated to be up to 100 times better than that
                      of humans. This incredible ability to detect scents plays
                      an important role in the grizzly bears' survival in the
                      wild.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Grizzly bears are powerful, top-of-the-food-chain
                      predators, yet much of their diet consists of nuts,
                      berries, fruit, leaves, and roots. Bears also eat other
                      animals, from rodents to moose.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Movement:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Generally, grizzly bears are active during the day and
                      can travel distances of 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32
                      kilometers) in a day, though they may travel farther in
                      search of food or a mate. <br />
                      -Despite their impressive size, grizzlies have been
                      clocked running at 30 miles / 48 kmh an hour.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Although variable in color from blond to nearly black,
                      grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and
                      commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -In North America, grizzly bears previously ranged from
                      Alaska down to Mexico and as far east as the western
                      shores of Hudson Bay the species is now found in Alaska,
                      south through much of western Canada, and into portions of
                      the northwestern United States (including Washington,
                      Idaho, Montana and Wyoming), extending as far south as
                      Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. In Canada,
                      there are approximately 25,000 grizzly bears occupying
                      British Columbia, Alberta, the Yukon, the Northwest
                      Territories, Nunavut, and the northern part of Manitoba
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Females produce one to four young (usually two) that are
                      small and weigh only about 450 g (16 oz) at birth. A sow
                      is protective of her offspring and will attack if she
                      thinks she or her cubs are threatened.

                      -They have a unique howl that can be heard from up to six
                      miles away in the forest and up to 10 miles away in open
                      terrain. Wolves howl to communicate with their pack
                      members, establish territory, and coordinate hunting
                      activities. In fact, scientists have found that each wolf
                      has a distinct howl, and pack members can identify each
                      other based on the pitch, duration, and frequency of their
                      howls.

                    <p>
                      -These social animals cooperate on their preferred
                      prey—large animals such as deer, elk, and moose. When they
                      are successful, wolves do not eat in moderation. A single
                      animal can consume 20 pounds (9 kg) of meat at a sitting.
                      Wolves also eat smaller mammals, birds, fish, lizards,
                      snakes, and fruit.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                      -The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and
                      black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be
                      nearly all white.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Movement:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Wolves live and hunt in packs of around six to ten
                      animals. They are known to roam large distances, perhaps
                      12 miles / 19 km in a single day. <br />
                      -They can run at speeds of up to 40-45 miles per hour
                      (64-72 kilometers per hour) for short distances.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Adaptable gray wolves are by far the most common and were
                      once found all over the Northern Hemisphere.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Wolves are monogamous, mated pairs usually remaining
                      together for life. Should one of the pair die, another
                      mate is found quickly. <br />
                      -Young females give birth to four to five young, and older
                      females from six to eight young and up to 14.

                    <p>
                      -They are also known as pumas, mountain lions, catamounts,
                      and panthers, depending on the region. For example, in the
                      eastern United States, they are often called panthers or
                      catamounts, while in the western United States and Latin
                      America, they are typically referred to as mountain lions
                      or pumas. This reflects the wide range of habitats that
                      cougars occupy and the different cultural traditions
                      associated with the species.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -In North America, mountain lions eat mainly deer, but
                      they also eat smaller animals, such as mice and rabbits.
                      These cats have a poor sense of smell, but have excellent
                      vision and hearing that help them hunt in the early
                      morning and evening hours <br />
                      -This carnivore stalks its prey until an opportunity
                      arises to pounce. Mountain lions “cache” their prey, or
                      hide it under leaves and soil, where they can come back
                      and feed on it over the course of several days.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                      -The head of the cougar is round and the ears are erect.
                      Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp
                      and hold large prey. It has four retractile claws on its
                      hind paws and five on its forepaws, of which one is a
                      dewclaw. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations
                      for clutching prey <br />
                      -Cougar coloring is plain, but can vary greatly across
                      individuals, and even siblings. The coat is typically

                      and give birth in a den. The cubs are born with spots,
                      which usually disappear by the time they are roughly nine
                      months old. Their eyes also change from blue to yellow by
                      the time they reach 16 months old. By 18 months, the young
                      cats leave their mom to go fend for themselves.

                      -they are excellent swimmers, despite their large size and
                      heavy build. They have been known to swim across rivers
                      and lakes, and can cover distances of up to half a mile
                      (0.8 kilometers) in the water.

                    <p>
                      -Bison are ruminants, which gives them the ability to
                      ferment plants in a specialized stomach prior to digesting
                      them. Bison were once thought to almost exclusively
                      consume grasses and sedges, but are now known to consume a
                      wide-variety of plants including woody plants and
                      herbaceous eudicots.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Buffalos have a thick, shaggy coat that is usually dark
                      brown in color. The hair on their head, neck, and
                      shoulders is longer and thicker than on the rest of their
                      body, giving them a distinctive "mane" and "beard." During
                      the winter months, their coat can become even thicker to
                      help insulate them from the cold. <br />
                      - Both male and female buffalos have horns, which are
                      curved and can grow up to two feet (0.6 meters) long. The
                      horns are made of bone and are used for defense and
                      dominance displays.

                      long distances at a lumbering gallop. <br />
                      -Wild buffalos have been known to travel up to 20 miles
                      (32 kilometers) in a day

                    <p>
                      -American bison live in river valleys and on prairies and
                      plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as
                      well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some
                      lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have
                      supported bison. They also graze in hilly or mountainous
                      areas where the slopes are not steep.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -The rutting, or mating, season lasts from June through
                      September, with peak activity in July and August. At this
                      time, the older bulls rejoin the herd, and fights often
                      take place between bulls. The herd exhibits much
                      restlessness during breeding season. The animals are
                      belligerent, unpredictable, and most dangerous. <br />
                      - Female bison can produce calves annually as long as
                      their nutrition is sufficient, but will not give birth to
                      a calf after years where weight gain was too low.

                      are so well adapted for running that they can even outrun
                      vehicles on highways and have been known to run alongside

                      them pinpoint the source of a sound, and they are highly
                      sensitive to both high and low frequencies. This helps
                      moose detect the approach of predators or other threats
                      from far away and gives them a better chance of avoiding
                      danger. In fact, moose can hear sounds up to 2 miles (3.2
                      kilometers) away!

                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Year-round, moose snack mostly on leaves, stems, twigs,
                      and the bark of small shrubs—and they eat plenty of all of
                      these things. A full-grown moose can gobble up to 70
                      pounds (31 kg) of food a day.
                    </p>

                      -After the mating season males drop their antlers to
                      conserve energy for the winter. A new set of antlers will
                      then regrow in the spring. Antlers take three to five
                      months to fully develop, making them one of the fastest
                      growing animal organs. <br />
                      -The antlers of mature Alaskan adult bull moose (5 to 12
                      years old) have a normal maximum spread greater than 200
                      centimeters (79 in). By the age of 13, moose antlers
                      decline in size and symmetry. The widest spread recorded
                      was 210 centimeters (83 in) across. <br />
                      -Moose have dark brown or black fur that is longer and
                      coarser in the winter to help them stay warm in cold
                      climates. They have a distinctive flap of skin under their
                      chin called a "bell" that is covered in long, shaggy hair.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Movement:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Moose have been known to dive over 5.5 metres (18 ft) to
                      reach plants on lake bottoms,[56] and the complex snout
                      may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are
                      the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater.
                      <br />
                      -When the winter ice melts, moose spend much of their time
                      swimming in lakes and rivers to keep their body
                      temperature down on hot days, sometimes swimming without
                      stopping for 10 or more miles (16 km). They are pretty
                      impressive on land too. An adult moose can run up to 35
                      miles (56 km) an hour for short distances and 20 miles (32
                      km) an hour for longer runs.

                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Moose primarily live in areas that have cold, snowy
                      winters. Their wide hooves act like snowshoes to help them
                      walk in the snow or in muddy, marshy ground after the snow
                      melts.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Rutting and mating occurs in September and October.
                      During the rut, mature bulls will cease feeding completely
                      for a period of approximately two weeks; this fasting
                      behavior has been attributed to neurophysiological changes
                      related to redeployment of olfaction for detection of
                      moose urine and moose cows. <br />
                      -When mating season is over in the fall, bulls (another
                      name for male moose) shed their antlers and head off to be
                      alone until next year’s mating season. Cows (another name
                      for female moose)typically give birth to one or two calves
                      in the spring. The calves stay with Mom for about a year
                      until the next mating season the following spring.

                      blood vessels near their eyeballs to trigger a surprise
                      spray. They aim the blood toward the predator’s mouth—it’s

                      they spend most of their time in the intense heat of the
                      desert during meals. They eat flies, spiders, and a

                      predator, they can quickly suck in air and puff up their
                      bodies to make themselves look larger and more
                      intimidating.

                    <p>
                      -The common chuckwalla is a large, flat-bodied lizard with
                      a large, rounded belly, and a wide-based, blunt-tipped
                      tail <br />
                      -In adult males, the head, shoulder, and pelvic regions
                      are black, while the midbody is light tan speckled with
                      brown <br />
                      - Adult females are brownish in color with a scattering of
                      dark red spots
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -they are found in deserts with rocks and crevices for
                      hiding, such as areas of past lava flows, rocky hillsides,
                      and outcrops <br />
                      -the common chuckwalla, inhabits deserts in the western
                      United States and Mexico and 30 known islands in the Gulf
                      of Mexico.

                    <p>
                      -Average clutch size per breeding season varies from 5 to
                      16 eggs <br />
                      -Females lay eggs in an underground nest. After common
                      chuckwallas hatch from their egg, they begin growing at a
                      rate of about 17 mm a year. <br />
                      -Common chuckwallas leave their young after they hatch and
                      the young are independent at that point.

                    <p>
                      -This iconic snake, with its bulbous head and red, yellow,
                      and black bands, is famous as much for its potent venom as
                      for the many rhymes—"Red and yellow, kill a fellow; red
                      and black, friend of Jack"—penned to distinguish it from
                      similarly patterned, nonvenomous copycats, such as the
                      scarlet king snake.

                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -They eat lizards, frogs, and smaller snakes, including
                      other coral snakes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                      -North American species average around 90 cm (3 ft) in
                      length, but specimens of up to 150 cm (5 ft) or slightly
                      larger have been reported. <br />
                      -Coral snakes in the United States are most notable for
                      their red, yellow/white, and black-colored banding.

                    <h2>Venom:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -coral snakes possess one of the most potent venoms of any
                      North American snake. However, relatively few bites are
                      recorded due to their reclusive nature and the fact they
                      generally inhabit sparsely populated areas. Even in areas
                      that are densely populated bites are rare.

                    <p>
                      -Coral snakes are found in scattered localities in the
                      southern coastal plains from North Carolina to Louisiana,
                      including all of Florida. <br />
                      -They live in the wooded, sandy, and marshy areas of the
                      southeastern United States, and spend most of their lives
                      burrowed underground or in leaf piles.

                      -The breeding season occurs from spring to early summer
                      and late summer to early fall. <br />

                    <p>
                      -When cornered, rattlers feverishly shake their iconic
                      tails as a last warning to back off. Rattles are made of
                      loosely attached, hard, hollow segments. Snakes add a new
                      rattle segment each time they shed. However, rattles break
                      off frequently, and snakes may shed their skin several
                      times a year, so it is not possible to determine a snake's
                      age by its rattle size.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Food:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -They mostly feed on birds, lizards, amphibians, fish,
                      invertebrates and mice are also preyed upon, with lizards
                      mostly being eaten by young snakes.

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Pattern of yellow-bordered, light-centered black diamonds
                      makes them among the most strikingly adorned of all North
                      American reptiles. <br />
                      -Adults commonly grow to 120 cm (4 ft) in length.
                      Specimens over 150 cm (5 ft) are infrequently encountered,
                      while those over 180 cm (6 ft) are very rare, and the
                      largest reported length considered to be reliable is 213
                      cm (7 ft)

                    <h2>Venom:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -Diamondback venom is a potent hemotoxin that kills red
                      blood cells and causes tissue damage. Bites are extremely
                      painful and can be fatal to humans. However, antivenin is
                      widely available throughout the snake's range, and bites
                      rarely result in death.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -These stout-bodied pit vipers generally live in the dry,
                      pine flatwoods, sandy woodlands, and coastal scrub
                      habitats from southern North Carolina to Florida and west

                    <p>
                      -The young stay with the mother for only a few hours
                      before they set off on their own to hunt and find cover,
                      so that the mortality rate is very high. <br />
                      -Mating occurs in the fall, and the females give birth to
                      as many as 25 young, which may be as long as 30 cm (12
                      in). <br />
                      -The young are fully capable of delivering a venomous bite
                      from the moment they are born.

                      capable of overpowering: slugs, earthworms (nightcrawlers,
                      as red wigglers are toxic to garter snakes), leeches,
                      lizards, amphibians (including frog eggs), minnows, and
                      rodents.

                      -Garter snakes are highly variable in appearance;
                      generally, they have large round eyes with rounded pupils,
                      a slender build, keeled scales (appearing ‘raised’), and a
                      pattern of longitudinal stripes that may or may not
                      include spots (although some have no stripes at all).
                      Certain subspecies have stripes of blue, yellow, or red,
                      mixed with black and beige-tan markings
                    </p>
                    <h2>Behavior:</h2>
                    <p>
                      -If disturbed a garter snake may coil and strike but
                      typically it will hide its head and flail its tail <br />
                      -Being heterothermic, like all reptiles, garter snakes
                      bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      - Garter snakes live in a variety of habitats, including
                      forests, woodlands, fields, grasslands and lawns, but
                      never far from water, often an adjacent wetland, stream or
                      pond. This reflects the fact that amphibians are a large
                      part of their diet. Garter snakes are often found near
                      small ponds with tall weeds. <br />
                      -Native to North and Central America, species in the genus
                      Thamnophis can be found in all of the lower 48 United
                      States, and nearly all of the Canadian provinces south of
                      the Northwest Territories and Nunavut
